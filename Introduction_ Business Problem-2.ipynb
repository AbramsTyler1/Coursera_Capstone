While one of the least populated provincial capital cities with a population base of less than 60 thousand residents, it offers a wide spectrum of venues and is a governement, university and cultural hub.\nAs the city grows and develops, it becomes increasingly important to examine and understand it quantitiatively. The City of Fredericton provides open data for everyone and encourages entrepreneurial use to develop services for the benefit of its ciitzens.\nDevelopers, investors, policy makers and/or city planners have an interest in answering the following questions as the need for additional services and citizen protection:\nWhat neighbourhoods have the highest crime?\nIs population density correlated to crime level?\nUsing Foursquare data, what venues are most common in different locations within the city?\nDoes the Knowledge Park really need a coffee shop?\nDoes the Open Data project have specific enough or thick enough data to empower decisions to be made or is it too aggregate to provide value in its current detail? Let's find out."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
